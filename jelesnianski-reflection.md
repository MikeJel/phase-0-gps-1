What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

The only thing that I get mixed up with on git is adding quotations during a commit and not on a branch. I'm still familiarizing myself with  Github so im a little slow. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Jamie pushed me a bit to try out things to see if they worked, I tend to hesitate before acting on what I type for instance I knew the MD command for links *sort of*.. and she told me to see what happened.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

My pair did not show up so this was all solo! But I did ask Jamie about things that fly over my head like the quotations and about the difference between git pull and fetch.

What still confuses you about Git?

I like to think I am at a point where I understand the core of Git. I know about branching, merging and workflow but I would like to learn more about hard resets when I mess up. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

First experience was fine, even though the pair didn't show up it just shows that if someone doesn't come through you need to push on and not wait.
